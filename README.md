# Lab Sample Integration Plugin (Python Demo)

This is a demo Python script that simulates a lightweight SLIMS integration plugin.

It:
- Reads sample data from a CSV file (like instrument output)
- Filters and cleans the data
- Formats each entry into JSON
- Sends each sample to a mock API endpoint
- Logs activity to a file (`plugin_log.txt`)
- Prints progress to the console

## 📁 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `lab_samples.csv` | Sample input data (CSV) |
| `lab_data_plugin.py` | Python script for reading, cleaning, and sending data |
| `plugin_log.txt` | Log file created automatically after running the script |
| `README.md` | You're reading it! |

## ✅ Requirements

You need Python 3 installed and the following packages:

```bash
pip install pandas requests
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you're in the folder with the script and CSV file
2. Run the script:

```bash
python lab_data_plugin.py
```

You’ll see output in the terminal showing the data processing and sending.

Logs are also saved to `plugin_log.txt`.

## 📡 Mock API

The script uses this mock API for demo purposes:

No real data is stored — it's just for testing.

## 🛠️ Customization Ideas

You can expand the script to:
- Read from Excel or instrument-generated files
- Connect to a real API or database
- Add email or retry logic
- Trigger the script on file drop (automation)

## 💬 Why This Exists

This small project simulates what an Application Engineer working with Agilent SLIMS might do:
- Connect lab instruments
- Parse scientific data
- Automate data entry
- Work with APIs
- Troubleshoot integration issues

Great for technical interviews or learning lab automation with Python.
